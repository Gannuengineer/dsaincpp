## Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and C++ Basics

This repository contains my solutions and practice code for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, along with basic C++ programming concepts. It includes a collection of code snippets, exercises, and algorithms covering key topics such as:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- C++ Basics (loops, conditionals, functions, etc.)

The goal of this repository is to improve my problem-solving skills and to provide a reference for others learning DSA and C++. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or use it as a resource for learning.
